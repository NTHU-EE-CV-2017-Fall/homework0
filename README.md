#homework0
This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My Name is Nischal Agrawal. I also have a chinese name, 武年熙. I come from India and I am here under a semester exchange program. I am 4th year Electrical Engineering student at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB).
I am fond of Signal Processing and Probabilty.Apart from these I like anime, music and Computer Games. 
I started learning Chinese 2 years back, and I am here to experience Taiwanese Culture and Language. I love making new friends and would be happy to hangout, if someone else is also reading this ;) .

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
Today we all are looking forward to Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality. And I think Computer Vision is major pillar where these cool technology stands. With a course in Computer Vision, I think I would get introduced
to these technology with the eye of an engineer, which I think would be super cool :P . Also I have done some image processing earlier and I really liked it. The understanding of Images/Videos for a normal person
and Image processing individual is radically different. And to apply all the cool mathematics and Signal Processing concepts to images is really exciting. So I am looking forward for the next step.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
I think the Computer Vision is very interesting, so I am looking forward to have a great time. I would get introduced to all the bottlenecks and challenges faced by the today's super cool technology. This would help me appreciate
all the efforts and brain put into the technology we see today. Apart form these, I think after this course I would be a better programmer, have more tools in my hand. And I hope to be able to use the concepts learnt in this course
to help me with my thessis in future.


PS. 中文 or English are both fine.
