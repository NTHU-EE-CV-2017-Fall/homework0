This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]

My name is Chun-Hung Chao, or you may call me Raul. I'm currently a MS student in [Vision Science Lab](http://aliensunmin.github.io/lab/info.html) supervised by [Prof. Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io). Recently, I'm focused on the biomedical imaging related topics, and I believe we can improve the world's health by applying these cutting-edge technologies.

From the talk, [opening remarks at the Artificial intelligence for good global summit](http://www.who.int/dg/speeches/2017/artificial-intelligence-summit/en/), given by Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), we know there could be numerous challenges lying ahead. But we're sure, whenever there is a challenge, there is also an opportunity for us to revolutionize the whole health sector.

## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]

For human beings, we use several senses, such as sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, to interact with environment. Among these senses, sight (or vision) is said to contain the richest information but also hard to understand how our brain process it. To make a machine doing corresponds to its seeing, no matter what method is applied, is the first step to endow a machine with intelligence. By those computer vision techniques, we're able to use machine to mine the visual information (some were not oberserved by human yet) from what it sees (by its cameras), and more complicated tasks could be done with machine.

## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]

I've done several computer vision related projects since I was a undergraduate student. However, most of my knowledge in this field is collected from Googling, and I've never take a regular CV class; This only reveils a little part of the fascinating computer vision science. I believe this course can give me insight into the computer vision, and I will be able to either apply or design CV methods more smoothly.
