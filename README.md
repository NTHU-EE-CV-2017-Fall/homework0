This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

## Brief self-introduction [max 500 words]
My name is Thattapon SURASAK. My nickname is Toffee. My Chinese name is 丁丹力. I was born in December, 1991. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Computer Engineering with Kasetsart University, Thailand. For the Research Project to achieve the Bachelor’s Degree, I worked on the research to create the software that uses for converting the simple sketching from 2D to 3D with the research topic as "2D and 3D Sketching on Air". This project has finished in 2014 and the software in final version can receive signals from the devices known as Leap Motion Controller, which is a hand’s gesture recognition device, and change a simple drawing such as circle, rectangle and triangle from 2D to 3D. After finishing the Bachelor’s Degree, I went to the United Kingdom to study the Master’s Degree at the University of Sunderland and I got the degree with distinction in Telecommunications Engineering on the 19th of February, 2016. In the aspect of the Research Project to achieve the Master’s Degree, the research topic is "An Evaluation of Quality and Security by deploying VPN for the VoIP system". I was working in the networking laboratories to create an application on Android (Mobile Operating System) that contributed the VPN (Virtual Private Network) technology with the VoIP to provide a free call between the secure networks. An application was created by the use of the Java programming language. Currently, I am doing my PhD in Communications Engineering at the National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan. My current research area is Financial Technology.


## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
I want to study the Computer Vision because I think this is the very important course to earn the knowledge in terms of Computer Vision. Moreover, Computer Vision is an adaptable area that can combine with too many research areas such as Computer Security and Machine Learning; so, the more I know, the more I grow. 


## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
I want to earn more knowledge and ideas about Computer Vision. This is because I am hundred percent sure that I will be able to create the combination research topic by adapt the Computer Vision based on some interesting research topic.
