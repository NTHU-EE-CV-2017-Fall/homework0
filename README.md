This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

Please don't mind I'm copying my airbnb introduction LOL

Hi, I'm Joey, a 23 years old graduate student and traveler from Hsinchu, Taiwan.
My mother tongue is Chinese, I also speak English and a little Japanese(JLPT N3).

I'm an amateur guitarist used to playing in a band. I listen to a variety of music genres like: metal, punk, jazz, blues etc.
I also love to watch movies and TV series, films directed by Christopher Nolan and David Finch are my favorites.

I love backpack and in-depth traveling.
I had travel to Japan 3 times. (Kansai region twice and Kanto once)
I also went to Summer Sonic 2016 on the trip.
Ramen is my favorite Japanese dishes, I had tried a lot of Japanese ramen chain stores in Taiwan, so if you know great places, please tell me. :)

Nice to meet you and wish you a good day.
