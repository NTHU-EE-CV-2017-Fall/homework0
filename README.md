This homework is simply used to check if all students know how to work with git and github (no credit).
At the sametime, it also helps me to know you a little bit more :)

	Programming language:C++,Matlab,python,C#(use in Unity)
	Interests:Piano(15 years+ experience),Texas holdem,computer graphic,write computer game
## Why Computer Vision? [max 500 words]
	Computer vision can not only be used on image data, the raw data such as audio file can
	also be solved by the same technic if the correct features been used.Plus,the computing speed
	will speed up alot if we use GPU to do multi data operation at the same clock cycle.
## What do you want to achieve in the course? [ max 500 words]
	I hope I can construct the whole neural network myself,solving some intereting problems
